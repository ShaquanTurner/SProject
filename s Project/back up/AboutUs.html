	<p style="color:#432D2D;font-size:20px;">"Our Vision
Despite being only a new company in a  most populous city in the Jamaica, Kingston consistently ranks in the top-5 Jamaican Cites for amounts of coffee consumed, number of coffee shops, and the number of coffee and tea producers. One could look at these numbers and conclude that there is a saturated market with no room for a newcomer. We disagree.

To us, Kingston's vibrant coffee market is more of an invitation than a deterrent. This city knows its coffee (as well as its Food, ice cream, and other Street Foods... basically anything that is delicious). So we decided to join in and help provide the market what it wants... and in our little section of Kingston, the market needs some serious help.

But Before we get to the Steets Please Take a look at our Website to order our Fanatastic goods.
